jsoncons
========

`jsoncons` is a C++ library for the construction of [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](http://www.json.org). It supports parsing a JSON file or string into a tree structured `json` value, building a `json` value in C++ code, and serializing a `json` value to a file or string. It also provides an event-based API for reading and writing JSON documents that are too large to fit into available memory, somewhat analogously to SAX processing in the XML world. A brief introduction may be found in [jsoncons: a C++ library for json construction](http://jsoncons.sourceforge.net/).

The library is header-only: it consists solely of header files containing templates and inline functions, and requires no separately-compiled library binaries when linking. It has no dependence on other libraries.

jsoncons uses some features that are new to C++ 11, particularly move semantics, however, it has been written to be compatible with VC++ 10 SP1 (note that SP1 is required for VC++ 10, it fixes compiler bugs with move semantics.) It has been tested with MS Visual C++ 10 SP1, Intel C++ Studio XE 2013, clang 3.3 and GCC 4.8. 

The code repository is on [github](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons), releases are on [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncons/?source=navbar). It is distributed under the [Boost Software License](http://www.boost.org/users/license.html)

To install the jsoncons library, download the zip file, unpack the release, under `src` find the directory `jsoncons`, and copy it to your `include` directory. If you wish to use extensions, copy the `jsoncons_ext` directory as well. 

0.93 Release
------------

New features

- Supports wide character strings and streams with `wjson`, `wjson_reader` etc. Assumes UTF16 encoding if sizeof(wchar_t)=2 and UTF32 encoding if sizeof(wchar_t)=4.
- The empty class `null_type`  is added to the `jsoncons` namespace, it replaces the member type json::null_type (json::null_type is typedefed to jsoncons::null_type for backward compatibility.)

Defect fixes:

- The ascii character 0x7f (del) was not being considered a control character to be escaped, this is fixed.
- Fixed two issues with serialization when the output format property `escape_all_non_ascii` is enabled. One, the individual bytes were being checked if they were non ascii, rather than first converting to a codepoint. Two, continuations weren't being handled when decoding.

0.92a Release
-------------

Includes contributed updates for valid compilation and execution in gcc and clang environments

0.92 Release
------------

Breaking change (but only if you have subclassed `json_input_handler` or `json_output_handler`)

- For consistency with other names, the input and output handler methods new to 0.91 - `value_string`, `value_double`, `value_longlong`, `value_ulonglong` and `value_bool` - have been renamed to `string_value`, `double_value`, `longlong_value`, `ulonglong_value` and `bool_value`.

Non breaking changes (previous features are deprecated but still work)

- `name_value_pair` has been renamed to `member_type` (typedefed to previous name.)

- `as_string(output_format format)` has been deprecated, use the existing `to_string(output_format format)` instead

Enhancements:

- `json` now has extensibilty, you can access and modify json values with new types, see the tutorial Extensibility 

Preparation for allocator support:

- The basic_json and related classes now have an Storage template parameter, which is currently just a placeholder, but will later provide a hook to allow users to control how json storage is allocated. This addition is transparent to users of the `json` and related classes.

0.91 Release
------------

This release should be largely backwards compatible with 0.90 and 0.83 with two exceptions: 

1. If you have used object iterators, you will need to replace uses of `std::pair` with `name_value_pair`, in particular, `first` becomes `name()` and `second` becomes `value()`. 

2. If you have subclassed `json_input_handler`, `json_output_handler`, or `json_filter`, and have implemented `value(const std::string& ...`,  `value(double ...`, etc., you will need to modify the names to  `value_string(const std::string& ...`,  `value_double(double ...` (no changes if you are feeding existing implementations.)

The changes are

- Replaced `std::pair<std::string,json>` with `name_value_pair` that has accessors `name()` and `value()`

- In `json_input_handler` and `json_output_handler`, allowed for overrides of the `value` methods by making them non-virtual and adding virtual methods `value_string`, `value_double`, `value_longlong`, `value_ulonglong`, and `value_bool`

Other new features:

- Changed implementation of `is<T>` and `as<T>`, the current implementation should be user extensible

- `make_multi_array<N>` makes a multidimensional array with the number of dimensions specified as a template parameter. Replaces `make_2d_array` and `make_3d_array`, which are now deprecated.

- Added support for `is<std::vector<T>>` and `as<std::vector<T>>`

- Removed JSONCONS_NO_CXX11_RVALUE_REFERENCES, compiler must support move semantics

Incorporates a number of contributions from Pedro Larroy and the developers of the clearskies_core project:

- build system for posix systems
- GCC to list of supported compilers
- Android fix
- fixed virtual destructors missing in `json_input_handler`, `json_output_handler` and `parsing_context`
- fixed const_iterator should be iterator in json_object implementation 

To clean up the interface and avoid too much duplicated functionality, we've deprecated some json methods (but they still work)

    make_array
Use `json val(json::an_array)` or `json::make_multi_array<1>(...)` instead (but `make_array` will continue to work)

    make_2d_array
    make_3d_array
Use `make_multi_array<2>` and `make_multi_array<3>` instead

    as_vector
Use `as<std::vector<int>>` etc. instead

    as_int
    as_uint
    as_char
Use `as<int>`, `as<unsigned int>`, and `as<char>` instead

Release 0.90a
-------------

Fixed issue affecting clang compile

Release 0.90
------------

This release should be fully backwards compatible with 0.83. 

Includes performance enhancements to json_reader and json_deserializer

Fixes issues with column numbers reported with exceptions

Incorporates a number of patches contributed by Marc Chevrier:

- Fixed issue with set member on json object when a member with that name already exists
- clang port
- cmake build files for examples and test suite
- json template method is<T> for examining the types of json values
- json template method as<T> for accessing json values

Release 0.83
------------

Optimizations (very unlikely to break earlier code)

- `get(const std::name& name) const` now returns `const json&` if keyed value exists, otherwise a const reference to json::null

- `get(const std::string& name, const json& default_val) const` now returns `const json` (actually a const proxy that evaluates to `json` if read)

Bug fixes

- Line number not incremented within multiline comment - fixed

Deprecated features removed

- Removed deprecated output_format properties (too much bagage to carry around)

Release 0.82a
-------------

- The const version of the json `operator[](const std::string& name)` didn't need to return a proxy, the return value has been changed to `const json&` (this change is transparent to the user.) 

- `get(const std::name& name)` has been changed to return a copy (rather than a reference), and json::null if there is no member with that name (rather than throw.) This way both `get` methods return default values if no keyed value exists.

- non-const and const methods `json& at(const std::name& name)` have been added to replace the old single argument get method. These have the same behavior as the corresponding `operator[]` functions, but the non-const `at` is more efficient.

Release 0.81
------------

- Added accessor and modifier methods `floatfield` to `output_format` to provide a supported way to set the floatfield format flag to `fixed` or `scientific` with a specified number of decimal places (this can be done in older versions, but only with deprecated methods.)

- The default constructor now constructs an empty object (rather than a null object.) While this is a change, it's unlikely to break exisitng code (all test cases passed without modification.)

This means that instead of

    json obj(json::an_object);
    obj["field"] = "field";

you can simply write

    json obj;
    obj["field"] = "field";

The former notation is still supported, though.

- Added a version of 'resize_array' to `json` that resizes the array to `n` elements and initializes them to a specified value.

- Added a version of the static method `json::make_array` that takes no arguments and makes an empty `json` array

Note that

    json arr(json::an_array);

is equivalent to

    json arr = json::make_array();

and

    json arr(json::an_array);
    arr.resize_array(10,0.0);

is equivalent to

    json arr = json::make_array(10,0.0);

For consistency the `json::make_array` notation is now favored in the documentation. 

Release 0.71
-------------

- Added `resize_array` method to `json` for resizing json `arrays` 

- Fixed issue with `remove_range` method (templated code failed to compile if calling this method.)

- Added `remove_member` method to remove a member from a `json` object

- Fixed issue with multiline line comments, added test case

- Fixed issue with adding custom data to a json array using `add_custom_data`, added examples.

Release 0.70
-------------

- Since 0.50, jsoncons has used snprintf for default serialization of double values to string values. This can result in invalid `json` output when running on a locale like German or Spanish. The period character (‘.’) is now always used as the decimal point, non English locales are ignored.

- The `output_format` methods that support alternative floating point formatting, e.g. `fixed`, have been deprecated.

- Added a template method as_vector<T> to the `json` class. If a `json` value is an array and conversion is possible to the template type, returns a `std::vector` of that type, otherwise throws an `std::exception`. Specializations are provided for `std::string`, `bool`, `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `long long`, `unsigned long long`, and `double`. For example

    std::string s("[0,1,2,3]");

    json val = json::parse_string(s);

    std::vector<int> v = val.as_vector<int>(); 

- Undeprecated the `json` member function `precision`

Release 0.60b
-------------

This release (0.60b) is fully backwards compatible with 0.50.

A change introduced with 0.60 has been reversed. 0.60 introduced an alternative method of constructing a json arrray or object with an initial default constructor, a bug with this was fixed in 0.60a, but this feature and related documentation has been removed because it added complexity but no real value.

### Enhancements

- Added `swap` member function to `json`

- Added `add` and `add_custom_data` overrides to `json` that take an index value, for adding a new element at the specified index and shifting all elements currently at or above that index to the right.

- Added `capacity` member functions to `json`

### 0.60  extensions

- `csv_serializer` has been added to the `csv` extension

Release 0.50
------------

This release is fully backwards compatible with 0.4*, and mostly backwards compatible to 0.32 apart from the two name changes in 0.41

Bug fixes

- When reading the escaped characters "\\b", "\\f", "\\r" and "\\t" appearing in json strings, json_reader was replacing them with the linefeed character, this has been fixed.

Deprecated 

- Deprecated modifiers `precision` and `fixed_decimal_places` from output_format. Use `set_floating_point_format` instead.
- Deprecated constructor that takes `indenting` parameter from `output_format`. For pretty printing with indenting, use the `pretty_print` function or pass the `indenting` parameter in `json_serializer`.

Changes

- When serializing floating point values to a stream, previous versions defaulted to default floating point precision with a precision of 16. This has been changed to truncate trailing zeros  but keep one if immediately after a decimal point.

New features

- For line reporting in parser error messages, json_reader now recognizes \\r\\n, \\n alone or \\r alone (\\r alone is new.)
- Added `set_floating_point_format` methods to `output_format` to give more control over floating point notation.

Non functional enhancements

- json_reader now estimates the minimum capacity for arrays and objects, and reports that information for the begin_array and begin_object events. This greatly reduces reallocations.

Release 0.42
------------

- Fixed another bug with multi line /**/ comments 
- Minor fixes to reporting line and column number of errors
- Added fixed_decimal_places setter to output_format
- Added version of `as_string` to `json` that takes `output_format` as a parameter
- Reorganization of test cases and examples in source tree

Release 0.41
------------

- Added non-member overload swap(json& a, json& b)
- Fixed bug with multi line /**/ comments 
- Added begin_json and end_json methods to json_output_handler
- json_deserializer should now satisfy basic exception safety (no leak guarantee)
- Moved csv_reader.hpp to jsoncons_ext/csv directory
- Changed csv_reader namespace to jsoncons_ext::csv
- json::parse_file no longer reads the entire file into memory before parsing
  (it now uses json_reader default buffering)

Release 0.40
------------

- json_listener renamed to json_input_handler
- json_writer renamed to json_output_handler

- Added json_filter class

- json get method that takes default argument now returns a value rather than a reference
- Issue in csv_reader related to get method issue fixed
- Issue with const json operator[] fixed
- Added as_char method to json
- Improved exception safety, some opportunites for memory leaks in the presence of exceptions removed
